=== What? ===

Well I wanted to learn some web programming and this is the result,
a web component that is able to display and edit binary data.

=== Requirements ===

You should have 'npm' and 'webpack' installed on your computer.

  $ brew install npm
  $ npm install -g webpack

=== Installation ===
  
  $ git clone git@github.com:agustingianni/react-hex.git
  $ cd react-hex
  $ npm install
  $ webpack
  $ npm run dev
  $ open http://localhost:8080

=== TODO ===

  - Load custom data instead of "random" bytes.
  - Make the UI great again.
